 # What I am most proud of
 How the  smaller enemies are much more threaning than the bigger generated enemies. because they are far harder to hit and harder to see 
 # Proposal 
My project will be a survival horror game where the player will be attacked by endless zombies. This will be based in a generated city enviroment.
